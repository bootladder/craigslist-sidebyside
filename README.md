**Pretty self explanatory, eh?**  

I used this for a bit, but then I realized an RSS reader does almost the same thing.  There are some things I don't like about `liferea` but I'm still using it.  
I could probably think of more features for this.  
  
* Easier modification of the URLs without having to go to cragslist itself or manually type.
  
The whole point of this is to show multiple searches side-by-side, which `liferea` doesn't do.
  
# Usage
`docker-compose up` should do the trick  
Point your browser to `localhost:8080/static`
  
The form buttons and inputs don't work... at the moment just edit the URLs by hand.
